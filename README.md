# DRL-RA

### Code
**For convenience in inspection and execution, each algorithm has been integrated into a single file.**

DDPG-RA.py contains the implementation of the standard DDPG algorithm as well as our DDPG with RA method.

SAC-RA.py contains the implementation of our SAC with RA method.

SAC.py contains the implementation of the standard SAC algorithm.



### Data

The JSON files record some algorithm-related parameters during training, such as episode scores, temperature coefficient α.

The PNG image files are plots generated from the training code output, used for visualization and included in our paper.
